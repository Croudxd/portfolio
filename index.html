        <p class="para">Hi there! My name is Ben and I am currently studying computer science at university. I am deeply inspired by the potential of artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize various industries. In my free time, I enjoy learning about and experimenting with different AI technologies and techniques. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field. I am excited to see where my passion for AI takes me in the future and am eager to continue exploring all that it has to offer.</p>
        <p class="para2">As a computer science student, I have had the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. These subjects have really sparked my interest and have given me a strong foundation for further exploring the field of artificial intelligence. In addition to my studies, I have also been fortunate enough to work on a few AI-related projects, which have allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in a practical setting.</p>
