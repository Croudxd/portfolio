            <h3>Stash</h3>
            <p>Stash is a 5 part imbedded system and client-server network
                which involves the use of AI models.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stash is esssentially a tablet which will scan your cupboard's using an esp32 imbedded device,
                and return these pictures from the Raspberry pi tablet, to the rust server, which will return a JSON message
                full of information about the scan of the cupboard (Such as what is in there, and how much it weighs).
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the project I completed for my FYP for my BSc in Computer science.

            <h3>Capital Audit</h3>
            <p>A Android app and custom Java spring backend, for user's finances.</p>
            <p>This was an android app built in android studio, it involved making API requests to the backend along with data transformation and building a GUI.</p>
            <p>This project was built in my second year at university and gave me a huge insight into how backend severs.</p>

            <h3>Tilly</h3>
            <p>This is a natural language processing AI assistant, which i built for fun.</p>
            <p>It basically uses python's natural language processing module to listen and parse data from a microphone into text, and when then quey a LLM
                to perform AI requests, with only needing to use your voice. So like alexa, but without the pre made responses uses AI to configure a reply.

            <h3>Env</h3>
            <p>This was another project built for fun, It is essentially a model of an enviroment, Built using directX graphics and in C/C++, it uses mathematic models
                to show how when different species interact with each other it can change the enviroment. Essentially showing the balance of nature using mathematic models
                with a low level display.
