            <h3>Stash</h3>
            <p>Stash is a 5 part imbedded system and client-server network
                which involves the use of AI models.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stash is esssentially a tablet which will scan your cupboard's using an esp32 imbedded device,
                and return these pictures from the Raspberry pi tablet, to the rust server, which will return a JSON message
                full of information about the scan of the cupboard (Such as what is in there, and how much it weighs).
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the project I completed for my FYP for my BSc in Computer science.

            <h3>Strategy-backend-engine</h3>
            <p>A modular, extensible backtesting engine written in Rust with automated data acquisition.</p>
            <p>Strategy-backtest-engine is a lightweight but extensible backtesting framework built in Rust with automated Python-based data ingestion. It is designed to simulate trading strategies on historical market data while emphasizing clarity, performance, and modularity. The project serves as both a practical tool for experimentation and a strong portfolio example of systems design, data processing, and quantitative analysis.</p>

            <h3>Env</h3>
            <p>This was another project built for fun, It is essentially a model of an enviroment, Built using directX graphics and in C/C++, it uses mathematic models
                to show how when different species interact with each other it can change the enviroment. Essentially showing the balance of nature using mathematic models
                with a low level display.
